# Image Captioning using CNN+LSTM

![Project Image](link_to_image)

## Overview

This project aims to generate descriptive captions for diverse image datasets by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The text generated closely aligns with the image content, demonstrating effective image understanding and natural language generation.

## Features

- **Advanced Technology**: Utilizes CNN and LSTM for accurate and context-aware image captions.
- **Diverse Image Support**: Capable of generating captions for various image datasets.
- **High Accuracy**: Produces captions that closely represent the image content.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Textwrap
